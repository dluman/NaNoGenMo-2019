# Shelter Should Be the Essential Look of Any Dwelling

Derived from a Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW) quote; one of his many dubious, showy, aphorisms.

# Abstract

This project leverages the concept of "Shape Grammar" and the work of Frank Lloyd Wright to attempt a kind of geometric/lexical translation of FLW's work. Outcome and method as yet unknown.

# Description

"Shape Grammar," a concept surfaced by George Stiny and James Gips in their 1971 work "Shape grammars and the generative specification of painting and sculpture," proposes alternate, geometric grammars for describing building plans. Indebted to Friedrich Froebel's "gifts," an undeniable and admitted influence on FLW's part, this approach to creating a descriptive geometric grammar may have applications in a lexical context (i.e. an approach to generative text) not unlike those of the Markovian or NLP approaches.

Or, to really stir things up as a kindred spirit to @cpressey (#11), I might flip some tables and say that individual shapes _are words_.

Key question: can "shape grammar" integrate into current or propose new methods for procedural generation.

(Frankly--pun intended--I have no idea if the above is true or means anything. It's November, which means it's time for trying stuff.)
