# NaNoGenMo-2019: Shelter Should Be the Essential Look of any Dwelling

Repository for "Shelter Should Be the Essential Look of any Dwelling," an attempt to think through narrative via the spatial concept of "shape grammar." To implement this, I relied heavily on the GIS-intended framework [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) -- a Python module which features simple methods for shape unions and general shape-making. Even though intended for a different discipline, I see quite a few applications for it in computational architecture vis-a-vis 2D shape grammars. 

## End-of-month Update

Who knows if it's any good? All I can say for certain is that this iteration is done. When I posted early results to Twitter, one user commented:

> I'd live here. I love the idea of never being quite certain there's not somethig *happening* in an area of the house I can't get to without leaving the possibly illusory safety of the bit I'm already in.

I appreciate how this contrasts/joins with/amplifies the title. I wasn't convinced that anyone would really respond to this somewhat asemic, aleatory operation. The above encouraged me greatly.

This branch of the project ends here. However, I plan to reshape the code developed during the month toward a different set of narrative possibilities. Of course, this means more planning and overall strategy. Much of the code here represents an end-of-the-month dash to get _something_ done (as is usually the case). As such, the PDF is a monster (it's 13,000+ pages), and the architect gets a little lazy with 2/ and 3 room houses, but they're all unique.
