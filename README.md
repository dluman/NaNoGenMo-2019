# NaNoGenMo-2019: Shelter Should Be the Essential Look of any Dwelling

Repository for "Shelter Should Be the Essential Look of any Dwelling," an attempt to think through narrative via the spatial concept of "shape grammar." To implement this, I relied heavily on the GIS-intended framework [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) -- a Python module which features simple methods for shape unions and general shape-making. Even though intended for a different discipline, I see quite a few applications for it in computational architecture vis-a-vis 2D shape grammars. 

## End-of-month Update

Who knows if it's any good? All I can say for certain is that this iteration is done.

FINAL WORD COUNT (purely text): 55,316

COUNTING SHAPES AS "WORDS" IN GRAMMAR: 96,803 (estimated)
